    <h1>Jquery Foundation Projects</h1>
    <h2>JQuery</h2>
    <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>jQueryUI</h2>
    <p>jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice.</p>
    <p>jQuery UI is built for designers and developers alike. We've designed all of our plugins to get you up and running quickly while being flexible enough to evolve with your needs and solve a plethora of use cases. If you're new to jQuery UI, check out our getting started guide and other tutorials. Play around with the demos and read through the API documentation to get an idea of what's possible.</p>

    <h2>jQueryMobile</h2>
    <p>jQuery Mobile is a HTML5-based user interface system designed to make responsive web sites and apps that are accessible on all smartphone, tablet and desktop devices.</p>
    <p>jQuery Mobile framework takes the "write less, do more" mantra to the next level: Instead of writing unique applications for each mobile device or OS, the jQuery mobile framework allows you to design a single highly-branded responsive web site or application that will work on all popular smartphone, tablet, and desktop platforms.</p>
    
    <h2>QUnit</h2>
    <p>QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself! </p>
    <p>QUnit was originally developed by John Resig as part of jQuery. In 2008 it got its own home, name and API documentation, allowing others to use it for their unit testing as well. At the time it still depended on jQuery. A rewrite in 2009 fixed that, and now QUnit runs completely standalone.
QUnit's assertion methods follow the CommonJS Unit Testing specification, which was to some degree influenced by QUnit. </p>
